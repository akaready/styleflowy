# @ready's StyleFlowy for Workflowy

Welcome to my lil' Github Repo for StyleFlowy. I love Workflowy. It's slowly replaced every other app I use over the past decade. A large reason behind that is how fast, powerful, simple, and (now) attractive it is to use. Hopefully you enjoy these added CSS customizations. Admittedly, I don't really fully understand Github, but figured this was the best place to drop this for folks to keep track of. 🤗

## Recommeded Usage 📝

I highly recommend using Jay (the artist formerly known as rawbtz)'s **Custom CSS Widget** to deploy the changes. Full info on his shared node.

He mentions in the above a great Chrome extension for editing live CSS in the browser. This is exactly how I prototyped things before commiting them to a master CSS doc (that I keep locally for archival purposes) before pasting in to the widget. If you want to play around, you can paste the entire CSS into the Live Editor, and see what each setting does by deleting the blocks. That's a good way to get started and see what you want to keep or not.

The wonderful part about Jay's extension is that it works on mobile. You'll find a handful of separately organized mobile styles that take full advantage of this. ✨

## Preview 👀

Here's a preview of what the styles will change!

## Buy Me a Coffee ☕

It was definitely a lot of work to dig up the classes, get thigs right, test, build variables, and add the comments in to make things easy to follow. If you like it, use it, or wanna fork it, please consider buying me a coffee! 🤗

Also, I'm not a master CSS coder by any stretch, but if you find me on the Workflowy Slack User Group, I'd be happy to try and answer questions for any supporters!
