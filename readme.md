# @ready's StyleFlowy for Workflowy

Welcome to Ready's respository of Worfklowy Styles. I love Workflowy. It's replaced every other app I use. A large reason behind that is how fast, powerful, simple, and (now) attractive it is to use. Hopefully you enjoy these customizations. Admittedly I don't really fully understand Github, but figured this was the best place to drop this. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Recommeded Usage‚ÄÇüìù

I highly recommend using Jay (the artist formerly known as rawbtz)'s Custom CSS Widget to deploy this.

He mentions in the above node a great Chrome extension for editing live CSS. This is exactly how I would prototype things before commiting them to a master CSS doc that I keep locally for archival purposes before pasting in to the widget. If you want to play around, you can paste the entire CSS doc into your Live Editor, and see what each setting does.

The wonderful part about Jay's extension is that it works on mobile. You'll find a handful of separately organized mobile styles that take full advantage of this. ‚ú®

## Buy Me a Coffee‚ÄÇ‚òï

It was a lot of work digging up these classes, getting thigs right, testing, building variables, and adding comments to make things easy to follow. If you like it, use it, or wanna fork it, please consider buying me a coffee! ü§ó
